    Hi Albert, this is my Pronunciation Test:<br><br>
    <strong>Okay, so here is the truth: I am leaving.<br><br>
I could not stay another day. I picked my fight and failed.<br><br>
I tried to tighten my routine, to straighten my desk, to make the plan perfect, but it kept getting harder. You would think I would be totally fine, or that I would just go quietly, but I had not written the last lines, I had not eaten properly, and I did not sleep.<br><br>
The same pattern kept repeating: I would push through the night, pull myself together by morning, and still my mood felt empty. People tried to help, a friend in the garden, a colleague at the bottom of the list, but they could not lift that burden.<br><br>
So, I decided: I am going to go. I am going to make my move today. Not later, but now. I am not saying it is easy, but it is necessary.<br><br>
I do not have every answer; I do not own all the truth, and that is okay. I know I will be tired, I know I will be tested, but I will be stronger for it.<br><br>
I want to find a place where the air sounds smooth and the moon feels steady. Maybe I will cross a mountain, maybe I will pass a fountain in a strange town, or maybe I will meet a person who makes me feel totally good.<br><br>
But I am not going back. I should not, and I will not. So here is my promise: I will keep moving, step by step, until the pattern breaks and something new can finally happen.</strong>
